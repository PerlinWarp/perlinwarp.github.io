# Gifts for a teenage programmer. 

When my parents would ask me what I wanted for christmas or my birthday I would never know what to say, this is a list of what I should have said. 

* SDR (Software Defined Radio) Around £10

A small USB radio dongle. 

* Arduino Around £5

A tiny computer that's great for personal projects. 
There are many different types of Arduinos. 

* Raspberry Pi [£35 for the best version](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-Pi-Model-64-Bit-Processor/dp/B07BDR5PDW/ref=sr_1_3/259-1013276-3647858?ie=UTF8&qid=1531652249&sr=8-3&keywords=rasberry+pi)

This is the classic that I thought everyone would know about
