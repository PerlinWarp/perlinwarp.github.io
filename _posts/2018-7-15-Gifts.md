When my parents would ask me what I wanted for christmas or my birthday I would never know what to say, this is a list of what I should have said. 

* SDR (Software Defined Radio) Around £10

A small USB radio dongle. 

* Arduino Around £5

A tiny computer that's great for personal projects. 
There are many different types of Arduinos. 
Theres the [official Arduino website](http://www.arduino.cc) that sell a [starter kit](https://store.arduino.cc/genuino-starter-kit). Amazon and E-Bay sells unofficial Arduinos, I quite like the [Sintron rip off of the Arduino Uno](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sintron-ATMEGA328P-Cable-Reference-Arduinos/dp/B00CGU1VOG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1531654429&sr=8-1&keywords=arduino+sintron).

* Raspberry Pi [£35 for the best version](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-Pi-Model-64-Bit-Processor/dp/B07BDR5PDW/ref=sr_1_3/259-1013276-3647858?ie=UTF8&qid=1531652249&sr=8-3&keywords=rasberry+pi)

This is the classic that I thought everyone would know about, there's so many projects to make from it.
