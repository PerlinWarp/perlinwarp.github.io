This page stores a list of things that I like. 


### YouTube

#### General Science
[Exurb1a](https://www.youtube.com/user/willunicycleforfood)
Exurb1a did a degree in philosophy and since has been filled with enough existential dread ever since. 

[Kurzgesagt â€“ In a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt)
Infographic like videos covering a range of science related topics. 

#### Maths 
[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)
Particularly fond of their linear algebra series. 3Blue focuses on the beautiful intuition behind maths and not the mechanics of calculating.  

#### Computer Science
[WelchLabs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UConVfxXodg78Tzh5nNu85Ew) 
When trying to learn neural networks, I looked at so many different sources but none of them really made it click until I watched the WelchLabs series on them.

#### Health and Life Style
[What I've Learned](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYPhGiB9tkShZorfgcL2lA)
A well informed channel usually focusing on health science that makes sense of many conflicting infomation about it. He makes polished, interesting videos and I like his style. 

#### Business 
[PolyMatter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgNg3vwj3xt7QOrcIDaHdFg)


### Books

#### Non Fiction
How to win friends and influence people. 
A book that teaches you how to deal with people. 

#### Fiction 
The Stranger - Albert Camus 
A short story that I quite enjoyed, especially as I am not usually a fan of fiction books. I usually loose interest but this one was interesting enough, not too hard to read and short enough to keep my interest.
