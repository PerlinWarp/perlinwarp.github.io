#### Maths 
[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)
Particularly fond of their linear algebra series. 3Blue focuses on the beautiful intuition behind maths and not the mechanics of calculating.  

#### Computer Science
[WelchLabs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UConVfxXodg78Tzh5nNu85Ew) 
When trying to learn neural networks, I looked at so many different sources but none of them really made it click until I watched the WelchLabs series on them.

#### Health 
[What I've Learned](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYPhGiB9tkShZorfgcL2lA)

#### Non Fiction
How to win friends and influence people. 

#### Fiction 
The Stranger - Albert Camus
